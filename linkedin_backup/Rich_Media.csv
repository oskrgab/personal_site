"You uploaded a feed document on June 18, 2025 at 5:00 PM (GMT)","One of the most unusual features of Excel is its support for writing formulas in multiple languages.

For some, this is one of the most nerve-wracking features ? since maintaining Excel sheets in different languages is way too confusing. And even though Excel will attempt to automatically translate the formulas to your default installation language, it won't be perfect ? especially when copy-pasting parts of a workbook in a different language.

If you ever run into this issue, be aware that there is a ""Functions Translator"" add-in in Excel that helps you with the formula translation and even provides a reference of the formula names in other languages.

I can see how Microsoft has tried its best to provide support for all languages possible. But honestly, it's unusual to have this multilingual support in formulas.

Why can't it be like programming languages?
