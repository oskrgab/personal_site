""2️⃣ Improved Communication: Bridging the gap between technical and non-technical teams, domain experts with software skills can facilitate more transparent, more effective communication, reducing misunderstandings and accelerating project timelines. ""

""""
""Thanks to all who participated in our poll. The correct answer is 𝐍𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. Let's explore why and how the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is crucial.""
""""
""🔍 The Scenario: Call arrivals at a service center followed a Poisson distribution (λ=2 calls per hour). We focused on daily averages over time.""
""""
""📈 The Central Limit Theorem: The CLT explains why sample means tend to form a normal distribution, even if the original data does not. In our case, the daily average call arrivals over a year demonstrated this principle (in the video below, I even tried it with 5000 days to see the bell shape better).""
""""
""Here's why the CLT applies:""
""""
""1. Large Sample Size: We recorded hourly calls, resulting in a large sample size, improving the theorem's accuracy.""
""""
""2. Independence: Each call arrival was independent, meeting the CLT requirement.""
""""
""3. Random Sampling: Call arrivals were random, resembling random sampling.""
""""
""🎯 Why Normal Distribution? The Poisson distribution governs individual call arrivals, but as we average them daily, the skewness diminishes, resembling a normal distribution. This transformation showcases the CLT's magic.""

""""
""As engineers, whether mechanical, civil, electrical, or petroleum, our journey into the world of programming is different, especially when we aim to augment our domain expertise rather than pivot careers entirely. Here's a perspective on how our programming path diverges from that of dedicated software developers:""
""""
""1️⃣ The Role of Programming: ""
""""
""For many engineers, programming is an optional tool, not a necessity. We often rely on applications like Excel or specialized software specific to our fields. Unlike developers, our core work doesn't mandate coding, which sometimes diminishes the immediate drive to learn it. However, when we do turn to programming, it's primarily to streamline and innovate our existing processes, aiming for efficiency and automation.""
""""
""2️⃣ Scientific Computing vs. Software Development: ""
""""
""Our academic foundations in calculus, physics, and numerical analysis nudge us towards scientific computing rather than pure software development. While engineers often seek to implement and solve domain-specific equations using libraries like NumPy, SciPy, or SymPy in Python, software developers dive deep into computer architecture, algorithms, data structures, and more, mastering languages like Java or C++.""
""""
""3️⃣ Embracing Data Science for Complex Phenomena: ""
""""
""When the complications of physical phenomena elude us, or when models become too complex, we turn to data science and analytics. This shift is fueled by the need to manage and interpret the vast data generated by modern equipment, driving many engineers towards programming languages like Python and R for data processing, insights generation, and even machine learning model development. This is one of the reason why many engineers started learning in programming the last few years.""
""""
""4️⃣ Prototype vs. Full-fledged Application: ""
""""
""Engineers excel at conceptualizing and creating working prototypes, harnessing our domain expertise and programming skills. Tools like Streamlit, Gradio, or Dash enable us to rapidly visualize our solutions. However, transforming these prototypes into robust, user-ready applications demands a deeper dive into software development, addressing aspects like user scalability, architecture, CI/CD pipelines, and ongoing maintenance.""
""""
""In conclusion, programming offers a powerful avenue for engineers to elevate their careers, providing tools to innovate and solve domain-specific challenges more efficiently. For those embarking on this journey, a focus on scientific computing and data manipulation can be particularly beneficial. ""
""""
""And remember, if your project evolves from a concept to a solution, collaborating with software developers can ensure that your application is not just built, but built to last. This synergy between engineering prowess and software development is not just beneficial but essential in today's tech-driven landscape.""

""Even though I mostly code in #python, and although it's getting faster, there is always a need to build safer and more maintainable software. You can do it in Python by trying to impose some static typing-like features such as type hints, mypy, pydantic, etc., but the truth is that the whole code will be as strong as the weaker piece of code in an external library.""

""""
""I believe my first exposure to it was when I was 14 years old when my dad told me he was able to create programs in his HP 48G by giving instructions to that small computer.""
""""
""That didn't mean that I started programming at that age 😓. I never thought about it again until my second year in college (5 years later). I had a course called ""Computing Fundamentals,"" an introductory programming class using MATLAB, which I enjoyed.""
""""
""However, the first time I learned a language with a purpose in mind was for the 'Well Test"" course in my petroleum engineering career, where I wanted to create a program that calculated the reservoir pressure, permeability and skin, given the well test information. In this way, I could avoid doing all of the calculations by hand, which could easily lead to errors and a low grade. That programming language was RPL (Reversed Polish Lisp), used in the HP calculators (recalling what my dad told me, thank you dad!). The program worked, and I managed to get an excellent grade 😁""
""""
""After that great experience, I wanted to create more advanced stuff, such as an iPhone app. I came across Paul Hegarty's iOS Development course in iTunes U around 2011, where I learned Objective-C (with a book from Stephen Kochan), OOP concepts, and the architectural paradigm of MVC. This fantastic experience opened my mind and made me understand that I did not know anything about programming or software development, which made me want to learn more.""
""""
""By the time I got a job, my favorite programming language was MATLAB. I was able to quickly implement engineering calculations and try domain-related apps such as MRST, an open-source reservoir simulator written in MATLAB. ""
""""
""After a couple of years, I met my current favorite programming language, Python 🐍. The reason I delved into Python was again because of a need. I had to create an uncertainty analysis in reservoir simulation. The tool that enabled this analysis had a Python API that allowed more control in creating the samples.""
""""
""That was six years ago, Python was easy to pick up (2 days) for the task I needed to complete, and it is extensible enough that it has kept me interested for all these years, and using it for almost every task in my day-to-day job.""
""""
""Finally, the last programming language I tried a year ago was R when I started my Masters's Degree in Analytics at Georgia Tech. Some of the courses are given in R, an excellent weapon to keep in your arsenal when doing analytics work.""
""""
""During this journey, I learned many things besides programming languages, like Git, DevOps, Agile Software Development, and, more recently, Cloud Technologies. I believe these are logical things to know if your purpose is not only to code but to create software. ""
""""
""So I'm curious, for those of you who had written code, what was your journey?""
