Welcome 👋!

If you are an engineer/consultant looking to leverage your domain expertise to create awesome products
and solutions, you are in the right place! 

I build tools that bridge technical expertise with practical
applications:

<div style="text-align: left;">

- [formulaML](https://formulaml.com) - Machine Learning in Excel
- [relperm](https://relperm.ocortez.com) - Saturation functions correlations for O&G.
- [volve-db](https://volve-db.ocortez.com) - Volve dataset to parquet files.
- [volve-explorer](https://volve-explorer.ocortez.com) - A web app to explore the Volve dataset (using volve-db!)

</div>

In my [blog]({{< ref "/blog/_index.md" >}}), I write about software development and data
science through the lens of an engineer who has struggled (I still do 😅) to find the right tools
and techniques to create value for my clients by developing domain-heavy applications.

I hope you can find something useful here and if you have any questions or comments,
please feel free to [contact me]({{< ref "/contact/index.md" >}})!
