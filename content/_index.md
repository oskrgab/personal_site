Welcome ðŸ‘‹!

If you are an engineer/consultant looking to leverage your domain expertise to create awesome products 
and solutions, you are in the right place!

In my [blog]({{< ref "/content/blog/_index.md" >}}), I write about software development and data 
science through the lens of an engineer who has struggled (I still do ðŸ˜…) to find the right tools 
and techniques to create value for my clients by developing domain-heavy applications.

I hope you can find something useful here and if you have any questions or comments, 
please feel free to [contact me]({{< ref "/content/contact/index.md" >}})!
