Here is a scenario that could happen to self-taught programmers:

1. The Python Prodigy: Mastering Data Analysis Beyond Excel.

You're a Python wizard, long past the days of using Excel for data analysis. Your workdays start with the excitement of launching a Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.

Ready to tackle any challenge with your scripting skills, you dive into tasks, process data, and deliver impressive results with plots and tables. This brings you joy and recognition 😎💻🔥. 

But then, something happens.

2. The Pitfall of Manual Versioning: Overconfidence and Duplicity.

A project you aced weeks ago needs revisiting with new data. You make copies of your original scripts and tweak them for the updated analysis. 

Suddenly, you're asked to revert to the old analysis for comparison. 

That's when things fall apart. 

Your script copies conflict, references break, and suddenly, your once-reliable code is a maze of errors 😩. 

After two days of debugging, you send out results, but they're full of mistakes, jeopardizing your reputation and the company's planning. 

3. Embracing Git: How Version Control Could Save Your Code (and Your Sanity)

This scenario could have been avoided with a Version Control System (VCS) like Git.

Even for solo projects, VCS is crucial. It allows you to:

💾 Safely Save Progress: Keep track of each change, ensuring you never lose your work.

💼 Effortlessly Manage Versions: Create branches for different versions or features.

🔧 Quickly Fix Mistakes: Easily return to a stable version when something goes wrong.

Even if you have mastered Python, it is crucial to incorporate software development practices into your work to ensure the maintainability of your codebase. These practices go beyond version control, but for now, start using Git.
