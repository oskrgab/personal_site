🧮 Working with derivatives, integrals, or differential equations?

Doing symbolic mathematics by hand is great when you are in college and still learning the fundamentals, but after a while, you might want to get some results quickly for your work, research or teaching!

Check out #SymPy, a powerful Python library for symbolic mathematics.

Here is an example using the diffusivity equation for flow in porous media 👇.
