If you’re learning Python, clearer error messages make all the difference — they’re more than just syntax alerts. Each release (from 3.10 through 3.14) keeps improving them: smarter typo hints, missing-argument names, colorized tracebacks — debugging is much more approachable and gentle for beginners nowadays. So yeah, the best time to start programming, every day, is today!
