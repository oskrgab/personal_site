As a guy who loves tech, I was always curious about the latest shining new technology, trying it, and doing something with it.

Of course it was great to know the latest thing, but it also made me waste too much time, too many times.

Over the years, life just happens and you don't have the time to do the same amount of things as before (work, family, health, etc) and now I just try to use the simplest technology, that:

- I can understand
- Makes me productive
- Increasingly useful
- Is affordable

Simplicity is one of the best ways to stay productive and definitely one you value even more over the years. 

Don’t waste too much time learning for the latest hot thing - check reviews, use cases and give it a go if it solves a problem for you.

Invest time learning skills that will move you forward for a long time (any programming, analytics, reading a book, doing an online course, etc) . 

And finally, when it comes to programming framworks or software, invest in tools that have lots of community support, so when you get stuck you find your way out. 

Invest in simple things that make your life easier.
