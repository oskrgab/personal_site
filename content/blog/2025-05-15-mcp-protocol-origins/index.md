Great insight into how MCP (Model Context Protocol) was born. Check out this podcast episode from Software Engineering Daily.

Interesting to learn that one source of inspiration for MCP was LSP (Language Server Protocol), which allows language-specific features like code completion, error checking, and refactoring to be implemented and distributed independently of any particular editor or IDE.

I know you can include MCPs in Cursor, but I haven't checked which are helpful for my work. 

How are you using MCPs? Have you built one yourself?
