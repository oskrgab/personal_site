If you like statistics and machine learning, you'll enjoy Bayesian Statistics.

Check out some of the best FREE resources to start learning:


- Statistical Rethinking: This is the best resource I've found so far. It starts with the fundamentals, and the code examples are in R and Stan. The accompanying book is available on Amazon too.
