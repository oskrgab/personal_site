Which AI tool is actually worth your time and money right now?

I’ve been testing different AI tools over the past few months—
some great, some not worth the cost.

If you’re trying to figure out the best combination of tools
for coding, writing, or just thinking clearly,

here’s what’s worked for me
(and what I’m considering switching to) 🧵

I use Cursor,
and even though I’ve never hit rate limits on the Pro plan,
it’s great for boilerplate code and tackling new tasks.

But, I prefer writing my own code—

LLMs often feel too verbose and complex.
But I rely on it more for Frontend features,
though I still check documentation with a quick Google search.

But then,
I’m paying for two services, each at $20/month.

I want to reduce my “AI bill”

and I’ve been glancing at Claude Pro 
as a potential ChatGPT + Cursor replacement.

It also includes Claude Code in the terminal,
which has lots of great reviews.

The only thing I’d miss from Cursor?
Tab completion.

I rely on it a lot in Cursor
to propagate quick changes.

It’s one of those features you don’t notice
until you need it—
especially when you’re the one driving the logic
and just want help executing it faster
without rewriting your whole codebase.

But then again...

Google just announced the #Gemini CLI.

It’s getting a lot of attention,
and early testing says it performs really well—
possibly even better than Claude Code.

I haven’t tested it yet,
but the free tier looks very generous (for now).

So here we are.

So many options
in such a short span of time.

But hey,
this kind of competition 
is great news for us—
the users.

Still, my approach stays the same:
Pick a few tools.
Master them.
Be as productive as possible
in the shortest amount of time.

What’s your current “AI tool” combo?
Have you tested Cursor, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI?
