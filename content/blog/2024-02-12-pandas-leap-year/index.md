I'm using pandas 🐼 date time features to celebrate my birthday! 🎉

Today marks my 34th year on this planet, and it's also a leap year!

While we all know that leap years occur approximately every 4 years, adding an extra day to February, I'm utilizing pandas to identify leap years during these last 34 years and showcase some of its impressive data manipulation capabilities.

We've all encountered time-series data, and pandas is my preferred library when working with this type of information. It proves especially useful when analyzing oil/gas production data.
