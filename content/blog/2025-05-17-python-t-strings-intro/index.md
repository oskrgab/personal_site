t-strings in #python. Because so many abused f-strings to write SQL and HTML 😅.

Still a nice addition to Python 3.14 to improve on flexibility and security.

The main idea is that you defer the rendering of the string, so you can customize the different data types that you have in your "template" object (which is the immediate result of the t-string)
