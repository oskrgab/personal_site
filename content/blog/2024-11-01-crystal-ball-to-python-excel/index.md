I used to run uncertainty analysis for reserves estimation in Excel using #CrystalBall. It was a popular tool that enabled complex modeling without coding.

Fast forward to 2024, and I can now do the same using #Python in #Excel. Take a look at it 👇

Tip: To access library methods like those in `scipy.stats` and work with cells, use the `getattrs` function. In the video, I demonstrate how to access different distributions within `scipy.stats` using a dropdown list. 🔍
