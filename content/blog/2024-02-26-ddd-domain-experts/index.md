Software developers use frameworks like Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to guide app development. 🛠

But what happens when you are the domain expert and learn to code? 🤔

For context, DDD is a software development approach focusing on the business domain elements and relationships, prioritizing them in the development process. Ideal for complex systems needing a deep understanding of their intended domain. 💻🔍🌐

Developers use domain experts (YOU) to apply DDD into the development process (hopefully). 

If we are the domain experts, what's the impact when we also know about software development?  Here are some good outcomes based on my experience:

1️⃣ Precision in Problem-Solving: By understanding both the domain and the complications of software development, experts can design solutions that are technically sound and profoundly aligned with business needs. 

2️⃣ Improved Communication: Bridging the gap between technical and non-technical teams, domain experts with software skills can facilitate more transparent, more effective communication, reducing misunderstandings and accelerating project timelines. 

3️⃣ Empowered Decision-Making: With firsthand knowledge of software capabilities, domain experts can make informed decisions, prioritize features, and steer projects with a clear vision of the end goal. 

4️⃣ Personal Growth and Versatility: Adding software development to your skill set not only enhances your marketability but also broadens your perspective, allowing you to approach problems with a more holistic view.

However, bear in mind that software development is naturally a team effort. Software development is incredibly vast, and once you get into this journey, you learn to appreciate what developers already know and how they make things easier for you. 

By learning how to code, you also make things easier for them, for you, and for your project.
