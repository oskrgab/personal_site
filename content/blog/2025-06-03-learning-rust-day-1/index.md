#LearningRust Day 1

I searched Google "What's the best way to learn #Rust". After spending about 10 minutes searching across different sites and Reddit posts, I'll focus on using two resources:

- The Rust Programming Language
- Rustlings

The first resource is the official documentation, which is the recommended starting point for learning Rust. I checked other suggestions for books, but I just want to keep my scope as minimal as possible (I'll use the interactive version - the one with quizzes)

The second resource, "Rustlings," is a Rust library that sets up a repository with small exercises to practice what you learn from the book. I was surprised to see that this type of resource exists for Rust, as I hadn't been aware of anything similar for Python.

Kicking off tomorrow with Rust and Rustlings installation!
