Have you ever heard about www.pythonanywhere.com? It is a hosting platform for Python web apps. It's ideal for small-scale projects and even offers a free tier for developing and deploying web applications.

Speaking of projects, I play in a local tennis league called TPL. The organizers have created a website to track scores, schedules, and leaderboards: https://lnkd.in/eApU2pTk
