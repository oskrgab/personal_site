Stop Writing Cryptic Python Code: Here’s How Meaningful Names Can Transform Your Engineering Projects

🧵 If you’re still using meaningless variable names in your Python code, please stop. In engineering & ML, clarity is not just a luxury—it's a necessity. Inspired by "Clean Code," here's why meaningful names are essential. #Python #CleanCode

🚫 The Cost of Cryptic Code: Using non-descriptive names like x, y, or f1 might save you keystrokes, but it costs you—and your team—hours of deciphering code. In engineering & ML, this can lead to misunderstandings, errors, and wasted time. #CodeQuality

📜 The Recipe for Clean Code: Always use meaningful names. It’s that straightforward. Let’s see a practical example. #PythonTips

🔍 Before:  What’s wrong?

• f1—What does this function do?
• x and y—Good luck figuring out their roles without context.
• df—A generic name that tells you nothing about the data.

✅ After:  Why this works:

• train_linear_regression_model—Instantly tells you the function’s purpose.
• features and target—Clarify the roles of the variables.
• engineering_data—Provides context about the dataset. #CleanCode

💡 The Bottom Line: Stop settling for cryptic code. Meaningful names are not just a good practice—they are a game-changer. Transform your Python scripts into clear, understandable, and maintainable assets. #Programming #CodeSmarter

👇 Don’t just write code; write code that speaks for itself.
