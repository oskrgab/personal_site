In today's world, data💾 is ubiquitous. However, there are instances where you need to load data quickly to experiment with new algorithms or test ideas. Here are some #Python libraries that provide ready-to-use datasets for your convenience 👇:

1. PyDataset

This library contains over 750 datasets, which are available upon installing the library.

2. Statsmodels

I use this library whenever I want to do time-series analysis with classic algorithms, but it also has a good selection of datasets that you can use immediately to test your code.

3. scikit-learn

One of Python's most popular ML libraries, it also contains a few toy datasets if you quickly need to test or review new algorithms.

7.1. Toy datasets — scikit-learn 1.3.2 documentation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html

With these libraries, there's no need to download datasets from external websites for quick tests. You can start working right away once you install the libraries. In fact, you might already have them installed!
