Do you find the process of installing Python cumbersome? Does it take up too much space on your computer?

If you work on multiple projects and create virtual environments for each one, you may have several unused environments and wasted disk space. 

What can you do? 👇🧵

Simplify with Cloud IDEs:

Create code environments linked to remote repositories. Code anytime, anywhere, on any computer. Keep your computer clutter-free with a cloud-based setup and skip lengthy onboarding for new team members.

Here are a few favorites!

1. Github Codespaces 

It's a cloud-based coding service with flexibility and scalability. Developers can access projects anywhere, collaborate, and enhance coding with cloud computing. It has a free tier of 120 core hours per month and 15 GB of storage.

2. Gitpod

This service allows you to spin up a coding environment in seconds with your packages and settings ready. You can launch the environment in VS Code or some of JetBrains IDEs. It comes with a generous free tier of 50 hours per month.

3. Replit:

Web-centric IDE with seamless development on all devices, including its mobile app. There are fewer customization options than Gitpod, but sharing live web applications is easier since it allows you to deploy your apps directly.

4. Google Colab 

Is a user-friendly web app for cloud-based coding, popular among developers and data scientists. You only need your existing Google account to use it! You can create notebooks and run your Python code like a Jupyter Notebook.

Even though you won't be able to escape the local setup at some point, these Cloud IDEs are very convenient for quick projects or even complex ones that facilitate onboarding new team members. 👍
