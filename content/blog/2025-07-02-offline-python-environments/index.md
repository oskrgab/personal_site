Python in Excel or the browser—fully offline. No servers. No installs. Just plug-n-code

Sounds too good to be true?

That’s exactly what tools like xlwings Lite, Anaconda Code, JupyterLite, and PySheets make possible today.

✅ Run Python code right inside Excel
✅ Or launch a full Python notebook in the browser
✅ All powered by Pyodide—an offline Python runtime that runs in your browser

But here’s the real question:

👉 What libraries can you actually use in this environment?
The good news: tons of your favorite ones are already supported—from pandas and matplotlib to scikit-learn, xgboost, bokeh, and more.

👇 I’ve grouped the most useful libraries by use case so you can explore what’s possible without digging through docs.
