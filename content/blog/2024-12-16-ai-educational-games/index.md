AI and parenting.

When hallucination is not a bug, but a feature.

Prompt:

“I want to play a riddle game with my kids to find these 5 stones. The yellow one will be hidden in the kitchen, the red one in the living room, the cyan one in the dining room, the transparent one in the office, and the brown one above the Roomba robot. Make a riddle game about the gems and locations on where to find them around the house.”

ChatGPT:

“Here’s a fun riddle game you can play with your kids to help them find the stones:

Yellow Stone (Kitchen):
“I’m bright and sunny like the morning light,
I’m where you make meals to take a bite.
Look near the tools that make things sweet,
Where could I be? Near something you eat!”

Red Stone (Living Room):
“My fiery color glows with cheer,
I’m hidden where you gather near.
By the cozy couch or a comfy seat,
Find me resting where you put up your feet!”

…

Brown Stone (Roomba Robot):
“My earthy tones blend with the ground,
I’m hiding where machines move around.
Above the one that keeps floors clean,
Find me waiting, I’m unseen!”

Kids were bored and I wanted to avoid screen time. With this, the kids had fun for at least 30 minutes and there are many different ways we can set this up later.

What’s your favorite day-to-day use of ChatGPT or any other model?
