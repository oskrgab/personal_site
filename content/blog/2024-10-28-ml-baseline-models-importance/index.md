Don’t Skip Baseline Models in Regression.

Data scientists often jump to complex models like XGBoost without checking prediction quality. MSE scores are common, but without a baseline, it's hard to judge their effectiveness.

Start with baseline models before diving into complexity:

• Mean Regressor: Predicts the average value of your target variable, giving you a basic reference point.

• Linear Regression: Simple, interpretable, and often a solid benchmark.

If your advanced model doesn’t significantly outperform these, you’re likely overfitting or over-engineering the problem. Always compare your results to baseline models first—complexity isn’t always better.
