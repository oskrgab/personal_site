Why I'm Falling for #Bayesian Statistics…

- Clear assumptions stated in the model through DAGs and priors.
- Ability to work with limited data while still yielding reasonable results.
- Incorporation of expert knowledge by defining priors and parameter relationships.
- Results presented as distributions (posterior).
- Easy model updates with new data.

Take a look at it, you won’t regret it.
