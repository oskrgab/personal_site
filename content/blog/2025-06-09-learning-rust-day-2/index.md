#LearningRust day 2

Installing #Rust

The recommended way is to install rustup from the command line or terminal. I'm using MacOS so I was tempted to see if an installation through #brew was available.

It is, but DON'T DO THAT. I've seen posts where people have downloaded Rust using brew and ran into many configuration problems, so I just stick with rustup.

Additionally, I successfully installed rustlings. Everything was a breeze. However, I wanted to take it one step further to force myself to learn Rust whenever I had a small window of time available.

So, I created a Replit project with Rust and rustlings installed. It works great and I can do the exercises on my phone.

Check the video to see it working!

Here you can remix the app if you want to try it yourself: https://replit.com/@oskrgab/rustlings
