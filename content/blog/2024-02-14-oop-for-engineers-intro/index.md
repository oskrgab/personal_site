Implementing a "Well" Class in Python🐍. Intro to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

You might have heard about OOP before. It is a great way to encapsulate, abstract, and represent real-world entities in code. 

Here, I use a well-known object for those working in the O&G industry (and other engineering fields) to introduce OOP.

Even though some scary concepts 😱 are related to this subject (inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction/interfaces, design patterns, etc..), let's try to forget that for a little while, and let's get our hands dirty by implementing this "Well" Class!!

It's always interesting to see the use cases you've given to OOP in your engineering code! Feel free to comment below 👇
