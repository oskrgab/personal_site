🚀 Machine Learning in Excel?

formulaML is my attempt to bring Machine Learning where people feel most confortable with and where their data already resides - Spreadsheets and using what they already know = formulas.

📊 No Python. No IDE. Just Excel formulas.

👇 Take a look at this syntax:

🔹 =ML.PREPROCESSING.STANDARD_SCALER()
🔹 =ML.DIM_REDUCTION.PCA()
🔹 =ML.CLASSIFICATION.LOGISTIC(,,,10000,0.1)
🔹 =ML.PIPELINE(A1,A2,A3)

💡 What’s going on here?

✅ Each cell defines a step in your ML pipeline
✅ You reference steps by cell, just like formulas
✅ No code. Just plug-and-play modeling
✅ Scikit-learn power, Excel simplicity

Perfect for:
-  Analysts who want ML superpowers
-  Excel power users tired of exporting data
-  Educators & students learning ML workflows
-  Teams that live in Excel but dream in models
