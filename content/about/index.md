## Hello friend 👋!
I'm Oscar.
I am a Reservoir Engineer based in Houston, TX,
but today I combine it with Data Science and Software Development.
I've been in the O&G industry for more than a decade now, and I'm currently working on 
CCS consulting projects, crafting custom software solutions and using advanced 
analytics to aid decision-making using domain expertise.

Even though I studied petroleum engineering, computers have always fascinated me since I 
started gaming on them (anyone remembers EarthSiege 2? 👀). This led to a passion for 
programming, which I've been pursuing as a self-taught skill since I was in college.

Soon after graduation, I started working for a multinational O&G service company 
performing different tasks including reservoir engineering, field development planning, 
software development, data science as well as combining all of them!

My tool of choice is Python 🐍, but my journey has led me to explore various technologies 
and methodologies, including Git, DevOps, Agile Software Development, and Cloud 
Technologies. I also took a deep dive into Data Science and finally completed my Master's 
Degree in Analytics at Georgia Tech in March 2023.

When I'm not glued to my computer screen 👀, I enjoy spending time with my family 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 and 
playing tennis 🎾, so if you want to play a match or talk about software, data science or 
petroleum engineering, feel free to get in touch with me [here](/contact) 🙂.

## Why this blog?
Throughout this journey in engineering and software, I've discovered the immense value 
of what a domain expert can do using the right set of tools. 

Domain experts (electrical, civil, petroleum, finance, etc) have the unique advantage of 
knowing their field and quickly find solutions that actually solve problems. 
However, many are hesitant to start coding, or developing software around those solutions 
because there are just so many tools out there, and it's hard to know where to start.

That's where this blog comes in.

My focus here is software development and data science, all through the lens of an 
engineer.
I've grappled with finding the right tools and techniques to build domain-heavy 
 applications, and this blog is my attempt to document and share those experiences.

Here, I discuss not just coding, but the other critical aspects that go into creating 
quality software – DevOps, Agile methodologies, and Cloud technologies. I also plan to 
share insights on the applications of analytics, and how we the engineers use it in our 
day-to-day job.

My aim is to help fellow engineers and consultants to leverage their domain expertise to 
create valuable solutions. If you're an engineer, a data scientist, a tech enthusiast, 
or someone simply curious about these fields, this blog is for you.

Together, we can learn and grow. If you have any questions or want to spark a 
discussion, don't hesitate to reach out.
