## Hello friend 👋!
I'm Oscar.
I am a Reservoir Engineer based in Houston, TX,
but today I combine it with Data Science and Software Engineering.
I've been in the O&G industry for more than a decade now, and I'm currently working on 
CCS consulting projects, crafting custom software solutions and using advanced 
analytics to aid decision-making using domain expertise.

Even though I studied petroleum engineering, computers have always fascinated me since I 
started gaming on them (anyone remembers EarthSiege 2? 👀). This led to a passion for 
programming, which I've been pursuing as a self-taught skill since I was in college.

Soon after graduation, I started working for a multinational O&G service company 
performing different tasks including reservoir engineering, field development planning, 
software development, data science as well as combining all of them!

My tool of choice is Python 🐍, but my journey has led me to explore various technologies 
and methodologies, including Git, DevOps, Agile Software Development, and Cloud 
Technologies. I also took a deep dive into Data Science and finally completed my Master's 
Degree in Analytics at Georgia Tech in March 2023.

When I'm not glued to my computer screen 👀, I enjoy spending time with my family 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 and 
playing tennis 🎾, so if you want to play match or talk about software, data science or 
petroleum engineering, feel free to get in touch with me [here](/contact) 🙂.

## Why this blog?
Throughout my journey in technology and engineering, I've discovered the immense value 
of knowledge sharing. Whether it's struggles, insights, or exciting findings, sharing 
our experiences can help others on a similar path.

That's where this blog comes in.

My focus here is software development and data science, all through the lens of an 
engineer.
I've grappled with finding the right tools and techniques to build domain-heavy 
applications and this blog is my attempt to document and share those experiences.

Here, I discuss not just coding, but the other critical aspects that go into creating 
quality software – DevOps, Agile methodologies, and Cloud technologies. I also plan to 
share insights from my ongoing journey in Analytics at Georgia Tech.

My aim is to help fellow engineers and consultants to leverage their domain expertise to 
create valuable solutions. If you're an engineer, a data scientist, a tech enthusiast, 
or someone simply curious about these fields, this blog is for you.

Together, we can learn and grow. If you have any questions or want to spark a 
discussion, don't hesitate to reach out.
